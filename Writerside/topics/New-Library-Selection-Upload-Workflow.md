# New Library/Selection Upload Workflow


## Overview
This is Rob & Mark's proposed workflow for adding new Selections and Libraries to LabGuru. 
We think it matches what was on the whiteboard during our meeting on 12/7/23.

## Sections
There are 4 sections that cover how we expect the process to work.

1. [](Library-Selection-Connectivity.md): 
This page shows how we expect parent/child links to work throughout a selection in the new system. It is the same
as what we showed on 12/7.

2. [](Selection-Upload-Process.md): 
The sequence diagrams on this page detail how the user (aka Meghan) will interact with the Slack app and how the app
will interact with LabGuru.

3. [](Example-Selection-Workflow.md):
This page describes an example selection. It details exactly what the user will upload and download during each step.
The Excel files can also be found on [Sharepoint](https://grobio.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/Projects/EpASWWePnN1GodsA76VaSogBYbp23Omo6VGWbD83TP5Otw?e=JECE7x).

4. [](Selection-Upload-Processing-Workflow.md):
The state diagram on this page details the programming logic of the upload app.
